## What is pair-review?

pair-review is a local web application for keeping humans in the loop with AI coding agents. Calling it an AI code review tool would be accurate but incomplete — it supports multiple workflows beyond automated review, from reviewing agent-generated code before committing, to judging AI suggestions instead of reading every line, to using AI to guide your attention during a thorough review. You pick what fits your situation.

### Two Core Value Propositions

1. **Tight Feedback Loop for AI Coding Agents**
   - Review AI-generated code with clarity and precision
   - Provide structured feedback in markdown format
   - Copy and paste feedback directly back to your coding agent
   - Create a continuous improvement cycle where you stay in control

2. **AI-Assisted Human Review Partner**
   - Get AI-powered suggestions to accelerate your reviews
   - Highlight potential issues and noteworthy code patterns
   - You make the final decisions - adopt, edit, or discard AI suggestions
   - Add your own comments alongside AI insights

## Why pair-review?

- **Local-First**: All data and processing happens on your machine - no cloud dependencies
- **GitHub-Familiar UI**: Interface feels instantly familiar to GitHub users
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI suggests, you decide
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for Claude, Antigravity, Codex, Copilot, OpenCode, Cursor, Pi, and Muse. Use your existing subscription!
- **Progressive**: Start simple with manual review, add AI analysis when you need it

## Workflows

There are no hard boundaries between these — mix and match as needed.

### 1. Local Review: Human Reviews Agent-Generated Code

**When to use:** You're working with a coding agent and want to review its changes before committing.

This is the core feedback loop workflow. When an agent generates code, open `pair-review` to review the uncommitted changes. With the GitHub-like UI, you can add comments at specific file and line locations, then copy that formatted feedback and paste it back into whatever coding agent you're using (or use MCP/skills to read comments directly into Claude Code).

Compared to giving feedback in chat, this feels like moving from a machete to a scalpel. Instead of trying to capture everything in one message, you can leave targeted comments at dozens of specific locations — and the agent addresses each one with surgical precision.

**How it works:**
1. Run `pair-review --local` to open the diff UI
2. Review changes in a familiar GitHub-like interface
3. Add comments with specific file and line locations
4. Copy formatted feedback and paste into your coding agent
5. Iterate until you're satisfied

**Tips:**
- Stage previous changes in git, then only review new modifications in the next round
- By default local mode reviews unstaged changes and untracked files; adjust the range with `--scope` (or the web UI scope selector) — e.g. `branch..untracked` to cover the whole branch (see [Local review scope](#local-review-scope))

### 2. Meta-Review: Judging AI Suggestions

**When to use:** You're not going to read every line of code. Let AI be your reader.

Instead of reviewing thousands of lines of code, you review a dozen AI suggestions. The AI reads the code; you review its recommendations. Each suggestion comes with enough context to evaluate it — even when you're not deeply familiar with the language or codebase.

Adopt suggestions you agree with, dismiss the rest, then feed adopted suggestions back to your coding agent. This is "supervised collaboration" — you stay in the loop without getting in the weeds.

**How it works:**
1. Open `pair-review --local` or `pair-review <PR-URL>` and click **Run Analysis**
2. AI performs three levels of review in parallel (see [Three-Level AI Analysis](#three-level-ai-analysis) below)
3. Results are deduplicated and combined by an orchestration step
4. Adopt suggestions you agree with, dismiss the rest
5. Feed adopted suggestions back to your coding agent

### 3. AI-Guided Review: When You're Accountable

**When to use:** You're reviewing code where someone is relying on your judgment. You're still reading the code — AI helps guide your attention and articulate feedback.

You're responsible for the review, but `pair-review` helps you be more thorough. Kick off the AI analysis and either wait for it to finish or start reading while it runs in the background. The AI suggestions guide you to areas worth attention and help you write clearer explanations. You can also do your own review first, then check whether the AI found the same things — a useful sanity check in both directions.

**How it works:**
1. Run AI analysis on the PR (in background or wait for results)
2. Read through the code with AI suggestions visible
3. Adopt suggestions you agree with, dismiss the rest, add your own comments
4. Submit as a rich, detailed review to GitHub

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Option 1: No installation required (npx)**

```bash
npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review <PR-number-or-URL or --local>
```

**Option 2: Global install**

```bash
npm install -g @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review
pair-review <PR-number-or-URL>
```

> **Tip:** Create an alias for frequent use:
> ```bash
> alias pr='npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review'
> ```

Either way, pair-review will:
1. Check out the PR branch locally (using git worktrees)
2. Open the web UI in your browser
3. Show you a familiar diff view (unified or split/side-by-side, switchable from the diff options menu)

> **Note:** The examples below use the shorter `pair-review` command. If you're using npx without a global install, substitute `npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review` instead.

### Review a Pull Request

```bash
# By PR number (in a GitHub repo)
pair-review 123

# By full GitHub URL
pair-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Review local uncommitted changes
pair-review --local
```

### Hiding generated files

In the diff options (gear icon), enable **Hide generated files** to remove files
marked `linguist-generated` in `.gitattributes` from the diff and file sidebar.
The additions, deletions, and changed-file totals then exclude those files.
The preference persists in your browser and works in PR and local reviews.
Turn it off to inspect generated changes; your comments and viewed state remain intact.

### Basic Workflow

1. **Review the diff** - See all file changes in a familiar GitHub-like interface
2. **Optional: Trigger AI analysis** - Get 3-level AI review insights:
   - Level 1: Issues in changed lines only
   - Level 2: Consistency within file context
   - Level 3: Architectural consistency across codebase
3. **Add comments** - Adopt AI suggestions or write your own
4. **Export feedback** - Copy as markdown to paste back to your coding agent
5. **Submit review** - Post to GitHub with approval status (or keep it local)

## Command Line Interface

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Review a pull request by number
pair-review <PR-number>

# Review a pull request by URL
pair-review <PR-URL>

# Review local uncommitted changes in the current directory or a specified path
pair-review --local [path]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `<PR-number>` | PR number to review (requires being in a GitHub repo) |
| `<PR-URL>` | Full GitHub PR URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`) |
| `--ai` | Automatically run AI analysis when the review loads |
| `--ai-draft` | Run AI analysis and save suggestions as a draft review on GitHub |
| `--headless` | Run AI analysis, store it in the local database, report the results, then exit. No browser, no GitHub post. Implies analysis (does not require `--ai`). Works with a `<PR-number-or-URL>` or with `--local`. If a compatible pair-review server is already running, the analysis is delegated to it so the web UI shows live progress (the CLI still waits and prints the same result). See [Headless analysis mode](#headless-analysis-mode). |
| `--json` | With `--headless`, emit the completed run plus its consolidated suggestions as a single JSON document on a clean stdout. For any outcome of the headless run (success, zero findings, or an error raised while running it), stdout carries a JSON document with an `ok` field; failures emit an `{ "ok": false, "error": … }` envelope on stdout with a non-zero exit. (Pre-flight config/startup failures are the exception: they exit non-zero with a stderr message and no JSON envelope — branch on the exit code first.) stderr is quiet by default (only warnings/errors) — add `--debug` for verbose progress logs. Only valid together with `--headless`. |
| `--no-server` | (Headless mode) Always run the analysis in-process, even when a compatible pair-review server is running — skips the delegation probe. Use for a fully isolated run with no live UI. Mutually exclusive with `--require-server`. |
| `--require-server` | (Headless mode) Require delegation to a compatible running server (so the web UI shows live progress). If none is available, fail fast (exit `1`, `{ "ok": false }` under `--json`) instead of falling back to in-process. Mutually exclusive with `--no-server`. |
| `--instructions <text>` | Per-run custom instructions for this analysis. Applies to any mode that runs analysis — `--headless`, `--ai-draft`, `--ai-review` (consumed directly), and `--ai`/`--council` (carried into the browser-triggered analysis). Rejected with a clear error if no analysis mode is selected, so it is never silently dropped. Default: none. |
| `--instructions-file <path>` | Read per-run custom instructions from a file (5000-character cap). Mutually exclusive with `--instructions`. |
| `--council <handle>` | Run analysis with a saved multi-voice council. Implies analysis. The handle resolves by council name, name-slug, id (prefix), or a partial name fragment (resolving when it matches a single council, otherwise listing the candidates). When set, `--model` is ignored (council voices use their own per-voice models). Works in headless PR (`--ai-draft`/`--ai-review`/`--headless`), interactive PR (`--ai`), and local (`--local --ai`) modes. |
| `--list-councils` | List saved councils with their handles, names, types, and last-used repo, then exit. Use a printed handle with `--council`. |
| `--configure` | Show setup instructions and configuration options |
| `-d`, `--debug` | Enable verbose debug logging for troubleshooting |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help message with full CLI documentation |
| `-l`, `--local [path]` | Review local uncommitted changes. Optional path defaults to current directory |
| `--scope <start>..<end>` | **Local mode only.** Set the diff range a local review covers. Stops (in order): `branch`, `staged`, `unstaged`, `untracked`. Six valid ranges (contiguous, must include `unstaged`); default `unstaged..untracked`. `branch..*` diffs from the merge-base with the base branch. See [Local review scope](#local-review-scope). |
| `--base <branch>` | **Local mode only.** With a `branch..*` scope, override base-branch auto-detection. Errors if used without a branch-start scope. |
| `--model <name>` | Override the AI model for any provider. Model availability depends on provider configuration. |
| `--provider <name>` | Override the AI provider. Applies to headless modes (`--ai-draft` / `--ai-review`) **and** to browser-driven auto-analysis (`--ai`), where it overrides the repo/app default the browser would otherwise use — including across single-port delegation to an already-running server. Defaults to the repo/app default provider (`claude`). Pair with `--model` when the model belongs to a non-default provider (e.g. `--provider codex --model gpt-5.6-sol-high`). |
| `--register` | Register `pair-review://` URL scheme handler (macOS only) |
| `--unregister` | Unregister `pair-review://` URL scheme handler (macOS only) |
| `--command <cmd>` | Custom CLI command for `--register` (default: `npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review`) |
| `-v`, `--version` | Show version number |

### Examples

pair-review --local --ai --council security-review    # Local review with a council
pair-review --local --headless         # Analyze local changes, print a summary, exit
pair-review --local --headless --json  # Analyze local changes, emit JSON, exit
pair-review 123 --headless             # Analyze a PR, print a summary, exit
pair-review --register                 # Register pair-review:// URL scheme (macOS)
pair-review --register --command "node bin/pair-review.js"  # Custom command
```

> **Councils** are saved multi-voice review configurations created and managed
> in the web UI (under Analysis settings). `--council <handle>` selects one from
> the CLI; the handle can be the council's name, its name-slug, an id prefix, or
> a partial name fragment (which resolves when it uniquely identifies a council,
> otherwise lists the candidates). Run `pair-review --list-councils` to discover
> available handles.

> **Repo default review config:** when neither `--council` nor `--model` is
> given, pair-review uses the repository's configured default — its default
> council if one is set, otherwise its default provider/model, otherwise the
> global config default. This applies to `--headless`, the submit modes, and the
> web UI's default **Analyze** action, so `--council`/`--model` are optional when
> a repo default is configured.

### Local review scope

`--scope <start>..<end>` sets which changes a **local** review covers (it has
no effect on PR reviews). The scope walks four ordered stops — `branch` →
`staged` → `unstaged` → `untracked` — and a range must be contiguous and always
include `unstaged`, since the AI models read files from the working tree and the
diff must cover that state. That leaves six valid ranges:

| Scope | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| `branch..unstaged` | All tracked changes since the base branch (committed + staged + unstaged); no new files |
| `branch..untracked` | Everything since the base branch, including new files |
| `staged..unstaged` | Staged changes plus working-tree edits vs `HEAD`; no new files |
| `staged..untracked` | Staged changes, working-tree edits, and new files |
| `unstaged..unstaged` | Only unstaged working-tree edits (staged changes treated as already reviewed) |
| `unstaged..untracked` | Unstaged working-tree edits plus new files (**default**) |

A scope ending at `untracked` includes new (untracked) files automatically — no
`git add -N` needed. `branch..*` diffs from the merge-base with the base branch.

`--base <branch>` overrides base-branch auto-detection for a `branch..*` scope.
Detection order when `--base` is omitted: Graphite stack state (only when
`enable_graphite: true` is set in `~/.pair-review/config.json`) → GitHub PR base →
`origin`'s default branch → `main`/`master`. `--base` errors if used without a
branch-start scope.

Both flags are **local-mode only**: they error when given a PR argument and do
**not** imply `--local`. An explicit `--scope` is persisted on the review
session, so opening the web UI for that review later shows the same scope.

```bash
# Review everything on this branch since it diverged from the trunk, plus new files
pair-review --local --scope branch..untracked

# Same, but against an explicit base branch (stacked branches / non-default trunk)
pair-review --local --scope branch..untracked --base develop
```

### Headless analysis mode

`--headless` runs an AI analysis (single provider or council), stores the results
in the local SQLite database exactly as the web UI does, reports them, and exits.
It never opens a browser or posts to GitHub — it is the analysis core without the
interactive or submit steps.

```bash
# Analyze uncommitted local changes, print a human-readable summary
pair-review --local --headless

# Analyze a PR (no review is created on GitHub)
pair-review 123 --headless

# Use a council and per-run instructions
pair-review --local --headless --council security-review \
  --instructions "Focus on auth and input validation."
```

**Live progress when a server is running (delegation).** If a compatible
pair-review server is already running on the configured port (same version, same
database), `--headless` hands the analysis *execution* to that server instead of
running it in-process. The server runs the exact same analysis, so its open web
UI shows the live council dialog updating in real time — while the CLI waits for
completion and then prints the identical result (same summary, byte-identical
`--json` document read from the shared database). This is what lets a `pair-loop`
run, or any `--headless` invocation, be watched live in the browser.

"Compatible" is strict: the server must report the same package version and
resolve the same SQLite database file as the CLI. Anything else — no server, a
version mismatch, or a different database — runs in-process as before. Two flags
tune the behavior:

- `--no-server` — always run in-process, even when a compatible server is
  running (skip the delegation probe). Use for a fully isolated run with no live
  UI.
- `--require-server` — require delegation to a compatible server. If none is
  available, fail fast (exit `1`, with an `{ "ok": false, … }` envelope under
  `--json`) instead of falling back to in-process.

The two flags are mutually exclusive and apply only to `--headless`. Delegation
is not available for MCP-stdio servers, which run on auto-selected ports with no
discovery — only the server on the configured `port` is delegable. During a
delegated run, `Ctrl-C` best-effort cancels the analysis on the server before the
CLI exits.

Delegation also skips (and the run stays in-process, with a stderr note) when
`--use-checkout` or `--yolo` is set: those flags act on the CLI's own process
(the current checkout, and this process's provider permissions), which a
separate server cannot honor.

One known limitation: configuration is loaded once at startup, so a delegated
run uses the *server's* startup config for global instructions, while an
in-process run reads the config fresh. Global instructions come from
`~/.pair-review/global-instructions.md` (loaded into `config.globalInstructions`
at startup), not a key in `config.json`. If you edit that file while a server is
running, restart the server (or pass `--no-server`) for the change to take
effect on delegated runs.

**Exit codes:** a successful analysis exits `0` regardless of how many findings it
surfaces (zero findings is still success, with an empty `suggestions` array).
Non-zero exit is reserved for operational errors — invalid flags, an unreadable
`--instructions-file`, or an analysis failure.

**Machine-readable output (`--json`):** add `--json` to emit the completed run
plus its consolidated final suggestions as a single JSON document on stdout, so
stdout is a clean, parseable document suitable for scripting and AI coding
agents:

```bash
pair-review --local --headless --json | jq '.suggestions | length'
```

Because this mode is consumed mostly by coding agents — whose shell tools capture
stderr alongside stdout — **stderr is quiet by default**: only genuine warnings
and errors are emitted, not progress narration. Add `--debug` to restore the full
verbose log stream on stderr when diagnosing a run.

The JSON document has this shape (fields reflect the stored run and the
consolidated suggestion layer the app shows by default):

```jsonc
{
  "ok": true,                 // false on failure (see below)
  "mode": "local",            // "pr" or "local"
  "consolidation": "success", // "success", "failed", "skipped", or null (see below)
  "run": {
    "id": "…",                 // analysis run id
    "review_id": 1,
    "provider": "claude",      // for a council run: "council"
    "model": "opus",           // for a council run: the council id
    "tier": "balanced",
    "config_type": "standard", // or "council" / "advanced"
    "status": "completed",
    "summary": "…",
    "total_suggestions": 3,
    "files_analyzed": 5,
    "started_at": "…",
    "completed_at": "…",
    "head_sha": "…",
    "parent_run_id": null,
    "custom_instructions": null,
    "global_instructions": null,
    "repo_instructions": null,
    "request_instructions": "Focus on auth…",  // from --instructions[-file]
    "levels_config": { /* parsed */ },
    "level_outcomes": { /* parsed */ }
  },
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "ai_run_id": "…",
      "ai_level": null,        // consolidated layer (per-level rows excluded)
      "ai_confidence": 0.9,
      "file": "src/app.js",
      "line_start": 120,
      "line_end": 124,
      "type": "bug",
      "title": "…",
      "body": "…",
      "severity": "high",
      "status": "active",      // active or adopted
      "is_file_level": 0,
      "reasoning": { /* parsed */ },
      "created_at": "…"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1                   // suggestions.length
}
```

**`consolidation`** reports the outcome of the final cross-level (and, for a
council, cross-voice) consolidation step:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `"success"` | Consolidation ran and merged the inputs. |
| `"failed"` | It threw. The run still completes and `ok` stays `true`, but `suggestions` is the raw union of every analysis level and every council voice rather than a merged review — expect duplicates and a much larger `count`. |
| `"skipped"` | There was nothing to merge — a council that resolved to a single voice or a single level, or an executable provider that returns its own final set. The suggestion set is the intended one; this is a healthy outcome, not a degraded one. |
| `null` | The run recorded no consolidation stage. |

Only `"failed"` indicates degraded output, so branch on that value rather than on
`!= "success"` — a single-voice council legitimately reports `"skipped"`. The
human-readable (non-`--json`) output prints a warning for `"failed"` only.

```bash
# Treat a degraded run as a failure
[ "$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.consolidation')" = "failed" ] && echo "unconsolidated!" >&2
```

**On failure** (invalid flags, an unreadable `--instructions-file`, or an
analysis error raised while running the headless flow) `--json` emits a JSON
document on stdout — a compact failure envelope — and the exit code is non-zero,
so a consumer parses one stream and branches on `ok`:

```jsonc
{
  "ok": false,
  "mode": "local",            // "pr" or "local"
  "error": { "message": "…" }
}
```

The envelope covers errors raised once the headless run is under way. A fatal
*pre-flight* failure — an unreadable or malformed `~/.pair-review/config.json`, an
unwritable config directory, or an invalid port — exits non-zero with a message
on **stderr** and does **not** emit a JSON envelope on stdout. Branch on the exit
code first (as the example below does), then parse stdout.

**Agent workflow.** A coding agent can run a headless analysis against its own
uncommitted work, parse the JSON, and act on the suggestions:

```bash
result=$(pair-review --local --headless --json \
  --council security-review \
  --instructions "Review the changes I just made for security issues.")

# Bail out on failure: non-zero exit, and `ok` is false in the JSON envelope.
if [ $? -ne 0 ] || [ "$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.ok')" != "true" ]; then
  echo "analysis failed: $(echo "$result" | jq -r '.error.message')" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Act on high-severity findings
echo "$result" | jq -r '.suggestions[]
  | select(.severity == "high")
  | "\(.file):\(.line_start) [\(.type)] \(.title)"'
```

Once the run starts, `--json` produces a JSON document on stdout for any outcome
— `{ "ok": true, … }` on success (any number of findings, including zero) and
`{ "ok": false, … }` with a non-zero exit on an error raised while running it —
so the agent reads exactly one stream and branches on `ok`. Because a pre-flight
config/startup failure is the one case that exits without a JSON envelope,
checking the exit code first (as above) covers every outcome.

## Configuration

On first run, pair-review will prompt you to configure the application.

**Token Requirements:**
- **Local mode** (`--local`): Works without a GitHub token - no configuration needed
- **PR review mode**: Requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to fetch PR data and submit reviews

Configuration is stored in `~/.pair-review/config.json`:

```json
{
  "github_token": "ghp_your_token_here",
  "port": 7247,
  "theme": "light",
  "default_provider": "claude",
  "default_model": "opus-5.5-high"
}
```

The `theme` option accepts `"light"`, `"dark"`, or `"system"` (follow the OS light/dark setting). The header toggle button cycles through all three per session — the `"system"` choice keeps the UI in step with your OS appearance as it changes. Until you pick a theme with the toggle, the UI follows your OS light/dark setting by default.

On first run, pair-review creates `~/.pair-review/config.example.json` with comprehensive examples of all available options, including custom provider and model configurations. Use this as a reference when customizing your setup.

For advanced configuration with custom providers and models, see [AI Provider Configuration](#ai-provider-configuration) below.

#### Feature toggles

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `external_comments` | `false` | Opt-in: set to `true` to fetch and display GitHub PR review comments inline. Enables the **External** segment, the refresh button, and `/api/reviews/*/external-comments*` routes. |
| `enable_chat` | `true` | Enables the chat panel feature (uses `chat_provider`). |
| `enable_graphite` | `false` | Show Graphite links alongside GitHub links, and name Graphite in the PR URL prompts and errors. Graphite PR URLs are accepted either way. |
| `skip_update_notifier` | `false` | Suppress the "update available" notification on exit. |

### Configuration Files

pair-review loads configuration from multiple files, merged in order of increasing precedence:

| Priority | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 (lowest) | Built-in defaults | Sensible defaults for all settings |
| 2 | `~/.pair-review/config.json` | Global user configuration |
| 3 | `~/.pair-review/config.local.json` | Personal overrides (gitignored) |
| 4 | `.pair-review/config.json` | Project-specific configuration (can be checked in) |
| 5 (highest) | `.pair-review/config.local.json` | Personal project overrides (gitignored) |

Nested objects (like `chat`, `providers`, `chat_providers`, `monorepos`) are deep-merged across layers — you only need to specify the keys you want to override.

**`config.local.json`** files are intended for personal overrides that should not be committed to version control. Add `config.local.json` to your `.gitignore`.

### Global Settings Page

Most global settings can also be viewed and edited in the app: open the gear icon on the landing page or navigate to `/settings`. Repo-specific settings remain on each repository's settings page, and the global settings page lists every configured repository with a link to its settings.

- **Effective value + source**: every setting shows its current effective value and where it came from — `in-app`, `env`, one of the config files, or `default`. A `default` badge means the setting was never explicitly set anywhere.
- **Persistence**: in-app edits are stored in pair-review's local database (`~/.pair-review/database.db`), never written back to your config files.
- **Precedence**: in-app settings > environment variables > `.pair-review/config.local.json` (project) > `.pair-review/config.json` (project) > `~/.pair-review/config.local.json` > `~/.pair-review/config.json` > built-in defaults. Repo-scoped settings and explicit per-run CLI flags still take precedence over global settings.
- **Reset**: a per-setting Reset button removes the in-app override, falling back to whatever the config files or defaults provide.
- **Immediate vs. restart**: most settings take effect immediately; a few (marked in the UI, e.g. retention windows and debug flags) apply on next start. Bootstrap values such as `port`, `db_name`, and tokens are shown read-only with their source.
- **Default for Analysis**: under **AI Defaults**, the **Default for Analysis** control is a single choice — either your Default Provider/Model pair (the rows below it) *or* a saved Review Council, picked from the same rich dropdown used on the repository settings page (it shows each council's name and Standard/Advanced type). When a council is selected, a composition preview beneath the dropdown shows its reviewers/models, levels, and consolidation — just like the repository settings page — while the base option shows a short hint that analysis uses the Provider/Model rows. A global default council is used wherever a repository has not chosen its own default council, and it outranks the global provider/model default. Precedence for analysis: explicit `--council`/`--provider`/`--model` per run › repo default council › **global default council** › repo default provider/model › global default provider/model. Note that single-model paths — hunk summaries, tours, and the MCP `start_analysis` tool — deliberately ignore councils, so a global default council does **not** change those (this matches how repo default councils behave).

Two config keys control the settings page itself:

- **Hiding settings** — `settings_ui.hidden`: an array of section ids (e.g. `"summaries"`, `"tours"`) and/or setting keys (e.g. `"tours.model"`) to hide from the page. Hiding is a display preference: it does not disable the feature (hiding the Summaries section does not turn summaries off). Because `settings_ui` merges like any other config key, a higher-precedence file can un-hide with `"settings_ui": { "hidden": [] }`.

  ```json
  { "settings_ui": { "hidden": ["summaries", "tours.model"] } }
  ```

- **Final settings** — `final`: an array of setting keys and/or section ids whose values are locked to what the config files declare. A final setting ignores in-app overrides *and* environment variables; the settings page shows it locked with a "final" badge. Unlike `hidden`, `final` declarations are unioned across all config files — a higher-precedence file cannot un-final a key; remove the declaration where it lives.

  ```json
  { "final": ["default_provider", "summaries.enabled"] }
  ```

### Alternate Git Hosts

pair-review can review pull requests on self-hosted Git platforms that expose a GitHub-compatible REST API, configured per-repository via `repos["owner/repo"].api_host` and related keys. By default an `api_host` repo is treated as living exclusively on the alt host; set `exclusive: false` on the repo entry to mark it as **dual-host**, where some PRs live on `github.com` and others on the alt host and pair-review resolves the host per PR. See [docs/alt-host.md](docs/alt-host.md) for the full configuration guide.

### Environment Variables

pair-review supports several environment variables for customizing behavior:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Personal Access Token (takes precedence over config file) | - |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_CLAUDE_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Claude CLI | `claude` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_ANTIGRAVITY_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Antigravity CLI | `agy` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_CODEX_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Codex CLI | `codex` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_COPILOT_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Copilot CLI | `copilot` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_OPENCODE_CMD` | Custom command to invoke OpenCode CLI | `opencode` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_CURSOR_AGENT_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Cursor Agent CLI | `agent` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_PI_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Pi CLI | `pi` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_OMP_CMD` | Custom command to invoke OMP (Oh My Pi) CLI | `omp` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_MUSE_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Muse Code CLI | `muse` |

**Note:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` is the standard environment variable used by many GitHub tools (gh CLI, GitHub Actions, etc.). When set, it takes precedence over the `github_token` field in the config file.

**Note:** Choose the AI provider and model with the `--provider` and `--model` CLI flags. There is no environment-variable equivalent (the provider/model env vars were removed in v5 — see the changeset for migration). The `--provider` flag selects which provider runs the analysis; `--model` selects the model within that provider, so set both when the model belongs to a non-default provider (e.g. `--provider codex --model gpt-5.6-sol-high`). The flag override outranks saved repository settings (`CLI flag > repo settings`); if the repo's default is a Review Council, an active `--provider`/`--model` override forces the single-provider path instead. To set a persistent default without passing a flag every time, use the `default_provider` / `default_model` config keys or the repo/global [settings pages](#global-settings-page).

**Delegation caveat:** With single-port mode (the default `single_port: true`), a new invocation delegates to an already-running server. On that path the `--provider`/`--model` override is carried to the running server only alongside browser auto-analysis (`--ai`). Delegating without `--ai` (just opening the review) does not seed the override into the other process's manual analysis dialog — use `--ai`, or a headless mode, to pin the provider on the delegated path.

These variables are useful when:
- Your CLI tools are installed in a non-standard location
- You need to use a wrapper script or custom binary

**Examples:**

```bash
# Use GitHub token from environment variable (CI/CD friendly)
GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxx" pair-review 123

# Use a custom path for Claude CLI
PAIR_REVIEW_CLAUDE_CMD="/usr/local/bin/claude" pair-review 123

# Use a wrapper command (supports multi-word commands)
PAIR_REVIEW_CLAUDE_CMD="devx claude" pair-review 123

# Use a custom path for the Antigravity CLI
PAIR_REVIEW_ANTIGRAVITY_CMD="/usr/local/bin/agy" pair-review --local

# Force a specific model for this review (use the --model flag)
pair-review 123 --model opus

# Force a specific provider + model for a headless review
pair-review 123 --ai-draft --provider codex --model gpt-5.6-sol-high

# Combine a custom CLI path with a model flag
PAIR_REVIEW_CLAUDE_CMD="/opt/claude/bin/claude" pair-review 123 --model haiku
```

**Note:** Multi-word commands (containing spaces) are supported. The application automatically handles these by using shell mode for execution.

### GitHub Token

Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with these scopes:
- `repo` (full control of private repositories)
- `read:org` (if reviewing organization repos)

[Create token on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

### AI Provider Configuration

pair-review integrates with AI providers via their CLI tools:

- **Claude**: Uses Claude Code CLI
- **Antigravity**: Uses the Antigravity CLI (`agy`), the successor to the Gemini CLI. Install it with `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash` (macOS/Linux; it is not an npm package) — see the [Antigravity docs](https://antigravity.google/docs). Antigravity is an analysis-only provider: it runs as an agentic reviewer in non-interactive print mode and has **no chat/ACP mode**.
- **Codex**: Uses Codex CLI. GPT-5.6 Sol High (`gpt-5.6-sol-high`) remains the recommended default during rollout. GPT-6.1 Sol High (`gpt-6.1-sol-high`) and XHigh (`gpt-6.1-sol-xhigh`) are explicit choices for reviews and chat; Enterprise and Edu administrators must enable GPT-6.1 Sol access.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Uses Copilot CLI
- **OpenCode**: Uses OpenCode CLI (requires model configuration)
- **Cursor**: Uses Cursor Agent CLI (streaming output with sandbox mode)
- **Pi**: Uses Pi coding agent CLI (requires model configuration)
- **OMP**: Uses the [Oh My Pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) CLI (`omp`), a fork of the Pi coding agent. Install it with `npm install -g @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`. Works out of the box: the built-in `default` mode uses whatever model your OMP configuration selects, and you can add specific models via `providers.omp.models` (run `omp models` to list the catalog). OMP's advisor runtime — which passively reviews each turn and injects notes — is disabled during reviews by default for deterministic, lower-cost analysis; set `"advisor": true` in `providers.omp` to opt back in.
- **Muse**: Uses Meta's Muse Code CLI (`muse`), a terminal coding agent released in beta in August 2026 and powered by the Muse Spark 1.3 model. Install it with the single shell command from Meta's Muse Code install instructions (macOS/Linux), then authenticate once with `muse login` (credentials are stored in `~/.config/muse/auth.json`). pair-review drives it headlessly via `muse exec --json`. Within pair-review, Muse is analysis-only: the CLI exposes no ACP server mode, so there is no Muse chat provider.

You can select your preferred provider and model in the repository settings UI.

#### Built-in vs. Configurable Providers

Most providers (Claude, Antigravity, Codex, Copilot, Muse) come with built-in model definitions. **OpenCode and Pi are different** - they have no built-in models and require you to configure which models to use. **OMP** sits in between: it ships a single `default` mode that delegates to your OMP configuration (`~/.omp/agent/config.yml`), so it works without any pair-review model configuration, and you can add specific models via `providers.omp.models`. OMP model `id`s are passed to `omp --model` verbatim, which fuzzy-matches (`"opus"`, `"gpt-5.2"`) and accepts full `provider/model` strings (`"anthropic/claude-opus-5"`).

##### Muse models and the contributor tradeoff

Muse exposes its built-in models as reasoning-effort variants over two underlying CLI models:

| Model ID | Tier | CLI model |
|----------|------|-----------|
| `muse-spark-1.3-max` | thorough | `muse-spark-1.3` |
| `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-max` | thorough | `muse-spark-1.3-contributor` |
| `muse-spark-1.3-xhigh` | thorough | `muse-spark-1.3` |
| `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-xhigh` | thorough | `muse-spark-1.3-contributor` |
| `muse-spark-1.3-high` | balanced (**default**) | `muse-spark-1.3` |
| `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-high` | balanced | `muse-spark-1.3-contributor` |
| `muse-spark-1.3-low` | fast | `muse-spark-1.3` |
| `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-low` | fast | `muse-spark-1.3-contributor` |

`muse-spark-1.3` and `muse-spark` are convenience aliases for `muse-spark-1.3-high`. `muse-spark-1.3-contributor` is likewise an alias for `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-high` — worth knowing because it is the bare CLI model name, so `--model muse-spark-1.3-contributor` selects the data-sharing tier described below rather than erroring out.

Muse Spark 1.3 is priced identically to 1.2 and is strictly better, so every `muse-spark-1.2-*` id (including the bare `muse-spark-1.2` and `muse-spark-1.2-contributor`) is kept as an alias of its 1.3 twin at the same reasoning effort — saved councils and configs upgrade in place. The former `-ultra` ids resolve to the `-max` entries: `--reasoning-effort ultra` is behind a closed feature gate and silently runs at `xhigh`, whereas `max` actually runs.

The `-contributor` models are substantially cheaper ($0.10/M input, $0.20/M output versus $1.25/M and $4.25/M) **because Meta may use their content for product improvement**. Since a code review sends your diff and surrounding source to the model, pair-review deliberately defaults to the non-contributor `muse-spark-1.3-high` — opting into data sharing is always an explicit choice you make by selecting a `-contributor` model, whether by its full ID or by that alias.

#### Configuring Custom Models

You can override provider settings and define custom models in your config file. This is useful for:
- Adding models to OpenCode or Pi (required for these providers)
- Overriding default commands or arguments
- Setting provider-specific environment variables

**Full provider configuration example:**

```json
{
  "github_token": "ghp_your_token_here",
  "default_provider": "opencode",
  "default_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
  "providers": {
    "opencode": {
      "command": "opencode",
      "extra_args": ["--verbose"],
      "env": { "OPENCODE_TELEMETRY": "off" },
      "default_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
          "tier": "balanced",
          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4",
          "description": "Fast and capable for most reviews",
          "tagline": "Best balance of speed and quality"
        },
        {
          "id": "anthropic/claude-opus-4",
          "tier": "premium",
          "name": "Claude Opus 4",
          "description": "Most capable model for complex reviews"
        },
        {
          "id": "openai/gpt-4.1",
          "tier": "thorough",
          "name": "GPT-4.1",
          "description": "OpenAI's latest model"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Provider Configuration Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `command` | CLI command to execute (overrides default and environment variable) |
| `extra_args` | Additional arguments to pass to the CLI |
| `env` | Environment variables to set when running the CLI |
| `installInstructions` | Custom installation instructions shown in UI |
| `availability_timeout_seconds` | Seconds to allow for the startup availability probe before the provider is reported unavailable (default `10`). Raise it for providers whose check runs a slow build/compile step. Also supported per chat provider under `chat_providers.<id>`. |
| `availability_command` | Command run to decide availability. Executable providers default to always-available when omitted; chat providers fall back to `<command> --version` (or, for the built-in Pi and OMP, the cached AI-provider status). Pair with `availability_timeout_seconds` when the probe runs a slow build. |
| `advisor` | OMP only. Set to `true` to enable OMP's advisor runtime during analysis (`--advisor`). Defaults to `false`: pair-review disables the advisor via a bundled config overlay, even when it is enabled in your global OMP configuration. |
| `models` | Array of model definitions (see below) |
| `default_model` | Model `id` to use as the provider's default (in the picker and when no model is specified). Preferred over the per-model `default: true` flag. If it names an unknown or disabled model, the provider falls back to automatic selection. |
| `disabled_models` | Array of canonical model `id`s to hide. Aliases (such as `opus`, or a retired id that now redirects to a newer model) are not matched and log a warning. Disabled models disappear from the model picker for that provider. Works on built-in models too, so you can remove a built-in option without redefining the rest. A list that would hide *every* model is ignored. |

#### Model Configuration Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Model identifier passed to the CLI |
| `tier` | Yes | One of: `fast`, `balanced`, `thorough` (aliases: `free`→`fast`, `premium`→`thorough`) |
| `name` | No | Display name in the UI |
| `description` | No | Longer description of the model |
| `tagline` | No | Short description shown in model picker |
| `badge` | No | Badge text (e.g., "NEW", "BETA") |
| `badgeClass` | No | CSS class for badge styling |
| `default` | No | **Deprecated** — use the provider-level `default_model` field instead. Set to `true` to make this the default model for the provider. Still honored for backward compatibility, but `default_model` takes precedence when both are present. |
| `cli_model` | No | Exact string passed to the CLI's `--model` flag, decoupling it from `id`. `null` suppresses the flag entirely (the provider uses its own default). |
| `extra_args` | No | Model-specific CLI arguments |
| `env` | No | Model-specific environment variables |
| `supports_chat` | No | Defaults to `true`. Set `false` for an analysis-only entry — it stays in the analysis model picker but is hidden from the chat model picker, and a chat session naming it falls back to the provider default. |

An entry that overrides a **built-in** model only replaces the fields it names for `cli_model`, `extra_args`, and `env` — so renaming or re-describing a built-in keeps its CLI model string and effort environment, in both analysis and chat. Display fields (`name`, `tier`, `tagline`, …) come from the entry itself, which is why `tier` is required even on an override.

#### Choosing and Hiding Models

Use the provider-level `default_model` and `disabled_models` fields to tailor which models a provider exposes — these work on **built-in** models too, so you can adjust a provider without redefining its entire model list.

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "claude": {
      "default_model": "sonnet-4.6",
      "disabled_models": ["haiku", "fable"]
    }
  }
}
```

- `disabled_models` removes those models from the picker. It matches canonical ids only (`opus-5.5-xhigh`, not the `opus` alias). An alias entry is ignored with a warning, so hiding a retired id such as `opus-4.7-high` never hides the newer model it now redirects to. To find the built-in IDs for a provider, see the comments in `config.example.json` (e.g. Claude ships `opus-5.5-medium`, `sonnet-4.6`, `haiku`, …).
- `default_model` selects which of the *remaining* models is the default. If it points at a model that is unknown or also disabled, the provider falls back to automatic selection (the model marked `default: true`, then the first `balanced`-tier model, then the first model).
- Prefer `default_model` over the per-model `default: true` flag, which is deprecated. Setting `default_model` suppresses the deprecation warning.

#### Model Tiers

Models are grouped by tier to help users choose appropriately:

- **fast**: Quick analysis, lower cost, good for simple reviews
- **balanced**: Best mix of speed and quality (recommended)
- **thorough**: Most comprehensive analysis, higher cost

Aliases are available for convenience: `free` (maps to `fast`), `premium` (maps to `thorough`).

#### Command Precedence

The CLI command used for a provider follows this precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Environment variable (e.g., `PAIR_REVIEW_OPENCODE_CMD`)
2. Config file `providers.<provider>.command`
3. Built-in default

## Features

### Three-Level AI Analysis

pair-review's AI analysis system examines your code changes at increasing levels of context:

- **Level 1 - Isolation**: Analyzes only the changed lines for bugs and issues
- **Level 2 - File Context**: Checks consistency within the entire file
- **Level 3 - Codebase Context**: Validates architectural patterns across the codebase

This progressive approach keeps analysis focused while catching issues at every scope.

### Analysis Configuration

There are three ways to configure which models run your analysis, each building on the last:

**Single Model** — Pick one provider and model. All enabled analysis levels run with that model, and consolidation uses the same model. The simplest option.

**Review Council** — Pick multiple provider+model combinations that all run in parallel across the selected analysis levels. You pick a separate consolidation model that merges everything together.

- Each reviewer can have its own timeout, instructions, and prompt tier (see [Model Tiers](#model-tiers))
- Results consolidate first across levels for each reviewer, then across reviewers
- Individual reviewer results are available alongside the overall council result

**Advanced** — For each enabled analysis level, pick different provider+model combinations. Level 1 might use a fast model while Level 3 uses a thorough one. Supports the same per-model options as Review Council (timeout, instructions, tier). Consolidation model is selected separately. Results consolidate first within each level (if multiple reviewers), then across levels.

The key difference from Review Council is consolidation order: Advanced consolidates within each level first, then across levels, so there are no per-reviewer rollups.

**Example use cases:**

- **Large changesets with Opus 4.6**: Use review council instructions to tell the model to use a Team — it will spawn sub-agents to divide the work
- **Multi-model parallel review**: Give each model a specific focus area (security, performance, correctness) via per-model instructions and get combined results
- **Cross-model perspectives**: Run the same analysis across different providers (e.g., Claude, Antigravity, GPT) — where models agree signals high-confidence findings, but unique outliers from a single model can be equally valuable, catching issue types that only that model excels at spotting

### Chat

Chat with a full coding agent while you review — it can read the codebase, answer questions, and interact with pair-review on your behalf. Powered by [Pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent).

**What you can do:**

- Ask questions about the code, architecture, or intent behind changes
- Have the agent pull related code into the diff panel as context files — see how changed code connects to the rest of the codebase without leaving the review
- Adopt, dismiss, or discuss AI suggestions directly from the conversation
- Create and edit review comments through chat
- Trigger new analysis runs with custom instructions
- Start conversations from context — an analysis run, an AI suggestion, a comment, any line or file
- Save reusable **prompt snippets** and insert them from a button in the chat input (Cmd/Ctrl+click to insert and send); Alt-click one of your sent messages to save it as a snippet; manage them from the chat popup or the [global settings page](#global-settings-page)

**Setup:**

```bash
npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent
```

Configure your preferred models in `providers.pi.models` — see [AI Provider Configuration](#ai-provider-configuration) for details. Everything else in pair-review works without Pi installed.

[OMP (Oh My Pi)](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi), a fork of Pi, is also available as a chat provider (`omp`) — it speaks the same RPC protocol through the `omp` CLI (`npm install -g @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`) and uses whatever model your OMP configuration selects (set a chat model via `chat_providers.omp.model`; values are passed to `omp --model`, which fuzzy-matches). Unlike Pi chat, OMP chat does not load pair-review's task extension; subagent delegation uses OMP's built-in `task` tool instead.

**Choosing a model:** The chat header includes a model picker, fed by the same per-provider model catalog used for AI review analysis (`providers.<id>.models` and `disabled_models` both apply; `default_model` does not — it is the *analysis* default, and chat's starting selection comes from `chat_providers.<id>.model` — see [AI Provider Configuration](#ai-provider-configuration)). The model is chosen before the first message is sent; once a conversation has messages, picking a different model opens a new tab (after a one-time "Start a new conversation?" dialog with a "Don't ask again" checkbox) rather than switching the model mid-conversation — pair-review keeps one model per chat by design. "Provider default" means the configured `chat_providers.<id>.model` if set, otherwise the CLI's own default. pair-review remembers the last model you picked for each provider in this browser and uses it as the starting model for new conversations (picking "Provider default" is remembered too). Effort variants like `opus-5-high` carry their effort env/flags into chat the same way they do for analysis.

Two `chat_providers.<id>` keys control this: `model` sets the default model for that chat provider (a catalog id, alias, or raw CLI model string, passed through verbatim if it's not in the catalog), and `models_from` picks which review provider's catalog the picker uses. Built-in chat providers map automatically (`copilot-acp` → `copilot`, `opencode-acp` → `opencode`, `cursor-acp` → `cursor-agent`; the rest map to their own id), and a config-defined chat provider falls back to its `type`.

**Chat provider command overrides:** To customize CLI commands for chat providers (e.g., to use a wrapper script), use the `chat_providers` config key:

```json
{
  "chat_providers": {
    "claude": { "command": "devx claude --" },
    "codex": { "command": "devx", "args": ["codex", "--", "app-server"] },
    "opencode-acp": { "command": "devx", "args": ["opencode", "acp"] }
  }
}
```

Available chat provider IDs: `pi`, `omp`, `claude`, `codex`, `copilot-acp`, `opencode-acp`, `cursor-acp`. Each supports `command`, `args` (replaces defaults; for `pi`, `omp` and `claude` there are no default args — supplied args are appended after the generated flags, so use a multi-word `command` like `"devx omp"` for wrappers rather than `args`), `extra_args` (appends), and `env` overrides, plus `model` and `models_from` (see **Choosing a model** above). Codex chat also supports `sandbox`: use `workspace-write` by default, or `read-only` for discussion-only sessions. (Antigravity and Muse are analysis-only providers — neither CLI has an ACP mode, so there are no Antigravity or Muse chat providers.)

**Keyboard shortcut:** Press `p` then `c` to toggle the chat panel.

### Customization

Tailor AI analysis to your team's standards and your current needs:

- **Repo-level instructions**: Always included when generating suggestions for a specific repo. Point to codebase best practices docs, highlight common review mistakes, or include other helpful resources. Reviews will actively cite this guidance when relevant.
- **Review-level instructions**: Customize individual reviews on the fly. Request deeper analysis with detailed code suggestions, ask for a "blockers only" final review, or adjust the focus for a particular set of changes.

There's a compounding benefit: if you run `pair-review` with the same coding agent you use for development — one already configured with your rules and instructions — it will actively search for violations and enforce them. The review reflects your standards, not generic best practices.

### Review Feedback Export

The killer feature for AI coding agent workflows:

1. Add comments during your review (manual or AI-assisted)
2. Click "Preview Review" to see formatted markdown
3. Copy the markdown
4. Paste into your coding agent's chat
5. Agent iterates based on your feedback

The markdown includes file paths, line numbers, and your comments - everything the agent needs to understand and act on your feedback.

### Inline Comments

- Add comments directly on specific lines
- See all comments in context with the diff
- Edit or discard AI suggestions before finalizing
- Comments include file and line number for precision

### GitHub Review Comments

When reviewing a PR, pair-review fetches existing inline review comments from GitHub and shows them in the diff alongside AI suggestions (orange) and your own draft comments (purple). External comments render as read-only blue-themed bubbles, with threads preserved (root plus replies). Each comment and each thread has a "Chat about this" button that opens the AI chat panel with the comment as context, so you can quickly ask the agent to investigate, explain, or draft a response.

Sync runs automatically when the PR page loads (non-blocking) and on demand via a refresh button — there's no need to reload the page to pick up new comments.

**Current scope:**

- **Read-only.** No reply, resolve, or adopt actions in this iteration — pair-review surfaces the conversation but doesn't write back to GitHub from these bubbles. Use your usual GitHub workflow to reply or resolve.
- **Inline (line-anchored) comments only.** The PR conversation tab (general issue comments) is not included.
- **Outdated comments are kept.** If later commits removed the anchor line, the comment renders at its original location with an "outdated" badge so historical context isn't lost.
- **No dedup of your own comments yet.** If you submitted a review from pair-review and later replied via the GitHub web UI, those replies may appear in the list under your GitHub username. Deduplication of pair-review-originated comments is on the roadmap.
- **GitHub only, PR mode only.** The fetcher is built on an adapter pattern in `src/external/` so additional sources (GitLab, Linear, etc.) can be added later, but GitHub is the only supported source today. Local mode reviews don't fetch external comments.

### Comment Format

When AI suggestions are adopted as review comments, pair-review formats them with an emoji and category prefix by default. You can customize this format via the `comment_format` setting in `~/.pair-review/config.json`.

**Presets:**

| Preset | Template | Example Output (without suggestion)|
|--------|----------|---------------|
| `legacy` | `{emoji} **{category}**: {description}{?suggestion}\n\n**Suggestion:** {suggestion}{/suggestion}` | 🐛 **Bug**: Missing null check |
| `minimal` | `[{category}] {description}{?suggestion}\n\n{suggestion}{/suggestion}` | [Bug] Missing null check |
| `plain` | `{description}{?suggestion}\n\n{suggestion}{/suggestion}` | Missing null check |
| `emoji-only` | `{emoji} {description}{?suggestion}\n\n{suggestion}{/suggestion}` | 🐛 Missing null check |
| `maximal` | `{emoji} **{category}**{?title}: {title}{/title}\n\n{description}{?suggestion}\n\n**Suggestion:** {suggestion}{/suggestion}` | 🐛 **Bug**: Null Safety Issue (includes title) |

To use a preset:

```json
{
  "comment_format": "minimal"
}
```

**Custom templates:**

You can provide a custom template using these placeholders: `{emoji}`, `{category}`, `{title}`, `{description}`, `{suggestion}`.

**Conditional sections:** Use `{?field}...{/field}` to conditionally include content. When the field value is truthy, the delimiters are stripped and the content is kept. When the field is empty/null/undefined, the entire block (including surrounding text within the delimiters) is removed. For example, `{?suggestion}\n\n**Suggestion:** {suggestion}{/suggestion}` will omit the entire suggestion line when there is no remediation text.

```json
{
  "comment_format": {
    "template": "{emoji} **{category}**: {description}{?suggestion}\n\n**Suggestion:** {suggestion}{/suggestion}",
    "emojiOverrides": {
      "bug": "🔴"
    }
  }
}
```

**Category overrides:**

Use `categoryOverrides` to rename categories in the formatted output. This is a string-to-string mapping where keys are the original category names (lowercase) and values are the replacement names.

```json
{
  "comment_format": {
    "template": "{emoji} **{category}**: {description}{?suggestion}\n\n**Suggestion:** {suggestion}{/suggestion}",
    "categoryOverrides": { "bug": "defect", "performance": "perf" }
  }
}
```

- `{title}` uses the suggestion's title field if available.
- `emojiOverrides` lets you replace the default emoji for specific categories.
- `categoryOverrides` lets you rename categories (e.g., "bug" to "defect").

Templates typically include `{description}` to render the suggestion body.

**Builtin categories:** bug, improvement, praise, suggestion, design, performance, security, code-style

### Local Mode

Review your uncommitted changes before creating a PR — by default the unstaged
working-tree edits plus untracked files, with the range adjustable via `--scope`
(or the web UI scope selector), e.g. `branch..untracked` to cover the whole
branch (see [Local review scope](#local-review-scope)):

```bash
pair-review --local
```

Perfect for:
- Self-review before committing
- Getting AI feedback on work-in-progress
- Iterating with a coding agent on local changes
- Reviewing only the unstaged files that are still changing
- Staging the files you've already reviewed and viewing the next round of changes

## Claude Code Plugins

pair-review provides three [Claude Code plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) that bring AI-powered code review directly into Claude Code.

### pair-loop — Agent-Orchestrated Review Loop

An implement→review→fix loop with pair-review as the review oracle. The agent runs multi-model council reviews through the headless CLI, triages the findings (fixing, dismissing with reasons, or asking you), applies fixes, and repeats with narrowing instructions until a final review returns no blockers. Every round persists to pair-review, and when the server is running the agent writes its triage back — so you can open the web UI, inspect every round, and see exactly what was fixed or dismissed and why. No MCP required.

**Install via Marketplace:**

```
/plugin marketplace add in-the-loop-labs/pair-review
/plugin install pair-review@pair-loop
```

**Available Skills:**

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/pair-loop:loop` | Implement, review with pair-review councils, triage, fix, and repeat until clean |

**Run the loop in your agent's main session — do not delegate it to a subagent.** Each council round is a 15–40 minute external process owned by the session that started it, so a subagent's exit kills the round mid-flight and the work is discarded. Delegating the implementation or fix work *within* a round is fine; delegating the loop itself is not.

### code-critic — Standalone Analysis

AI-powered code review analysis that works without any server or MCP dependency. Install this plugin for three-level AI analysis directly in your coding agent.

**Install via Marketplace:**

```
/plugin marketplace add in-the-loop-labs/pair-review
/plugin install pair-review@code-critic
```

**Available Skills:**

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/code-critic:analyze` | Run three-level AI analysis using Task agents directly (standalone, no server needed) |

Looking for an implement-review-fix loop? That's the [pair-loop plugin](#pair-loop--agent-orchestrated-review-loop) above, which replaced the former `/code-critic:loop` skill.

These skills work standalone. If the pair-review MCP server happens to be available (from the pair-review plugin), `code-critic:analyze` will use it for prompts and push results to the web UI — but it's entirely optional.

### pair-review — App Integration

Full integration with the pair-review web UI via MCP. Install this plugin to open reviews in the browser, run server-side AI analysis, and address review feedback.

**Install via Marketplace:**

```
/plugin marketplace add in-the-loop-labs/pair-review
/plugin install pair-review@pair-review
```

**Available Skills:**

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/pair-review:pr` | Open the current branch's GitHub PR in the pair-review web UI |
| `/pair-review:local` | Open local uncommitted changes in the pair-review web UI |
| `/pair-review:analyze` | Run AI analysis via the pair-review MCP server (results appear in web UI) |
| `/pair-review:user-critic` | Fetch and address human review comments from pair-review |
| `/pair-review:ai-critic` | Fetch and address AI-generated suggestions from pair-review |

This plugin includes the pair-review MCP server, which starts automatically when the plugin is enabled.

### Alternative: Load Plugins Locally

If you prefer not to use the marketplace, load plugins directly from an npm-installed or cloned copy:

```bash
# From a local clone
claude --plugin-dir ./path/to/pair-review/plugin-pair-loop
claude --plugin-dir ./path/to/pair-review/plugin-code-critic
claude --plugin-dir ./path/to/pair-review/plugin

# From a globally installed npm package
claude --plugin-dir "$(npm root -g)/@in-the-loop-labs/pair-review/plugin-pair-loop"
claude --plugin-dir "$(npm root -g)/@in-the-loop-labs/pair-review/plugin-code-critic"
claude --plugin-dir "$(npm root -g)/@in-the-loop-labs/pair-review/plugin"
```

### Team Setup

To pre-configure plugins for all contributors on a repository, add this to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "pair-review": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "in-the-loop-labs/pair-review"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "pair-review@pair-loop": true,
    "pair-review@code-critic": true,
    "pair-review@pair-review": true
  }
}
```

Team members will be prompted to install the marketplace and plugins when they trust the repository folder.

## MCP Integration

pair-review exposes a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) interface, allowing AI coding agents to programmatically read review feedback. The MCP server is included automatically when you install the pair-review Claude Code plugin. For standalone MCP setup (without the plugin), see [Standalone MCP Setup](#standalone-mcp-setup-without-plugin) below.

### Transport Modes

**stdio (recommended)** — run pair-review as a stdio MCP server. The agent communicates via stdin/stdout JSON-RPC while the web UI launches on a local port for the human reviewer:

```bash
npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review --mcp
```

**HTTP** — the Streamable HTTP endpoint at `http://localhost:7247/mcp` (stateless mode) is available whenever the pair-review web server is running.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Availability |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `get_server_info` | Get pair-review server info including web UI URL and version | stdio only |
| `get_analysis_prompt` | Get rendered analysis prompts for a review level and tier | stdio + HTTP |
| `get_user_comments` | Get human-curated review comments (authored or adopted), grouped by file | stdio + HTTP |
| `get_ai_analysis_runs` | List all AI analysis runs for a review | stdio + HTTP |
| `get_ai_suggestions` | Get AI-generated suggestions from the latest analysis run, or from a specific run via `runId` | stdio + HTTP |
| `start_analysis` | Start an AI analysis in the app for local or PR changes | stdio + HTTP |

All review tools accept lookup parameters:
- **Local reviews**: `path` + `headSha`
- **PR reviews**: `repo` (e.g. `"owner/repo"`) + `prNumber`

`get_ai_suggestions` also accepts an optional `runId` to target a specific analysis run (discovered via `get_ai_analysis_runs`), bypassing the need for review lookup parameters.

### Standalone MCP Setup (Without Plugin)

If you want just the MCP tools without the full plugin (no skills), you can add the MCP server directly to any coding agent that supports MCP (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.).

#### Generic MCP Configuration

**stdio transport (recommended)** — run pair-review as a child process. The agent communicates via stdin/stdout JSON-RPC:

- **Command:** `npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review --mcp`
- **Environment variables:** Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` if you want PR review support (not needed for local-only reviews). GitHub token will also be read from `~/.pair-review/config.json` if configured.

**HTTP transport** — connect to a running pair-review instance:

- **URL:** `http://localhost:7247/mcp` (stateless Streamable HTTP)
- Start the server first with `npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review` or by opening a PR review, then point your agent at the HTTP endpoint.

You can also copy the `plugin/.mcp.json` file from this package into your project for agents that support `.mcp.json` discovery.

#### Claude Code Specific

Add the MCP server via the Claude Code CLI:

**stdio transport (recommended):**

```bash
claude mcp add pair-review -- npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review --mcp
```

**HTTP transport:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http pair-review http://localhost:7247/mcp
```

These commands update your MCP configuration in `~/.claude/settings.json` (user-level) or your project's `.claude/settings.json` (project-level).

## FAQ

**Q: Does my code get sent to the cloud?**
A: Not by pair-review. Pair-review keeps all its data locally. AI providers that you use for review may communicate with their servers.

**Q: Do I need to use AI analysis?**
A: No. pair-review works great as a local review UI without AI. Trigger analysis only when you want it.

**Q: Which AI provider should I use?**
A: Any that you have configured locally. Claude excels at code review, but try different providers to see what works best for you.

**Q: Can I use this for non-GitHub repos?**
A: Local mode (`--local`) works with any git repository. PR review mode requires GitHub.

**Q: How do I give feedback to a coding agent?**
A: Add comments during review, click "Preview Review", copy the markdown, and paste it into your coding agent's chat interface.

**Q: Something isn't working right. What should I try first?**
A: Try refreshing your browser. Many transient issues resolve with a simple page refresh.

**Q: How do I use OpenCode as my AI provider?**
A: OpenCode has no built-in models, so you must configure them in your `~/.pair-review/config.json`. Add a `providers.opencode.models` array with at least one model definition. See the [AI Provider Configuration](#ai-provider-configuration) section for a complete example.

**Q: How do I use Pi as my AI provider?**
A: Like OpenCode, Pi has no built-in models. Configure them in your `~/.pair-review/config.json` by adding a `providers.pi.models` array with at least one model definition. Pi supports many providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) via its `--provider` and `--model` flags. See the [AI Provider Configuration](#ai-provider-configuration) section and `config.example.json` for examples.

**Q: How do I use OMP (Oh My Pi) as my AI provider?**
A: OMP works out of the box: the built-in `default` mode uses whatever model your OMP configuration (`~/.omp/agent/config.yml`) selects. To pin specific models, add a `providers.omp.models` array — each model's `cli_model` is passed to `omp --model` verbatim, which fuzzy-matches and accepts `provider/model` strings (run `omp models` to list the catalog). During reviews pair-review disables OMP's advisor runtime by default (it injects notes into each turn, adding cost and nondeterminism); set `"advisor": true` under `providers.omp` to enable it.

**Q: Why does chat use Pi instead of Claude or other providers?**
A: Pi provides persistent interactive sessions with a full agent — it can read files and run commands in the context of the codebase. Pi is model-agnostic and uses your existing provider subscriptions — no separate API keys needed.
